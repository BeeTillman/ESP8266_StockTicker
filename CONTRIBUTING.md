# Contributing

This project was a passion project that I built as a learning opportunity.
Due to this, this repository is open to all forms of contribution.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer
